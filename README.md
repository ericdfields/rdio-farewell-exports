# What?

A list of public repos of rdio users' export data.

# Why?

A lot of us really loved rdio for a lot of different reasons. There's probably insight to be gleaned from aggregating data from as many of its pationate users as possible.

Could potentially be the biggest resource of music listening habits made public?

Because data, that's why.
